<p>During the reading, the following three questions came up for me:</p>
<p>The line "notice how these rules guide the creation of that situation" even if the specific situations aren't defined anywhere in the rules. Could this line of thinking apply to things outside of video games, such as understanding systems of everyday life?
Would changing the rules in these systems truly erase the problems that arise from them? What makes a game long-lived?</p>
<p>For the first question, I do believe this line of thinking could be applied to other systems that govern day to life, at least in understanding how they work. The causes may not always be easily pinpointed, but the effects are often plain to see, since they result
in tangible actions and decisions that are felt by multiple parties. The deed itself is what matters most, and not necessarily the doer. The doer in those cases could be multiple different forces interacting at once, rather than a single entity with malicious intent.
Sociology is a good example of this line of thinking being applied to something outside of games. In fact, many games-- through their storytelling-- explore sociological themes. These can be anything from learning how to navigate gender identity in a binary world, 
race and how that changes the way people treat you and the amount of opportunities you are offered, how the perception of others based on these systems impacts you individually, and how you in turn impact others because of the experiences born from all these
bundles of processes. These experiences aren't clearly defined or accounted for in this country's rules, yet it's because of those rules that these situations can in fact happen.</p>
<p>Changing the rules in these systems, then, would certainly help to amend more specific situaitons, but the overall problem comes from the way the system-- and the experiences that come as a result of it-- cause us to think. The effects of the system, then,
are not merely through the physical consequences that can be perceived with our senses, but how it alters our perception of the world as a whole. Games, then, become a way for us to dissect and examine our ways of thinking. To question where those thoughts come from,
how it helps us, where it fails, and who benefits most from making us believe in something. Not only through storytelling means, but through gameplay means, such as multiple branching paths and the endings that come out of the decisions you've made. In that sense,
games mirror different parts of our world, like a diamond having multiple facets. What games then do, is explore a specific facet and give you a new perspective on it.</p>
<p>For the final question, what makes a game long-lived is a question that depends on what the game itself is trying to achieve, and how well it succeeds at what it wants to do. Horror games, for example, aim to instill a sense of dread and fear in the player by
exploring the fear of the unknown in all of us. What makes people remember a horror game, even years after its launch, is how well they can recall that sensation of terror and understand what makes that specific game terrifying. For a more gut-wrenching tragedy,
its success depends on how strong the emotional beats of the story are, how well it makes you get attached to the characters, and knowing how the tragedy could have been prevented-- even though it was inevitable. A game is long-lived when it embeds itself into
our long term memories, through its commitment to its goal, and the heart that goes into creating it from their human designers.</p>
