![A photo of an old movie projector.](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/461998989/photo/photo-of-an-old-movie-projector.jpg)
<p> the screen stands still, with no thought of motion  
nor inclination of such desire.</p>
<p>and yet, the light dances along the edge  
like a performer's pre-meditated steps in an empty dancehall. unknowing  
of the audience who thinks her to be real.</p>
