<h5> The Light That Bends</h5>
![image](film_projector.png)

<p> the screen stands still, with no thought of motion</p>
<p></p>nor inclination of such desire.</p>
<p>and yet, the light dances along the edge</p>
like a performer's pre-meditated steps in an empty dancehall. unknowing  
<p></p>of the audience who thinks her to be real.</p>
