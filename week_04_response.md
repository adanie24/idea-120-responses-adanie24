<p>An example of hot media could be a poem, at least when read in solitude. A poem intensely engages your eyes as you read it, requiring you to pay attention to the language above all else.</p>    
<p>The diction, the line breaks, the end stops, the imagery are the most integral pieces of a poem in order to understand its meaning. It also means that as you read intently, your own
interpretation of the poem will naturally begin to form.</p>

<p>One example of cold media could be a cast script reading, before rehearsals begin for a play or a musical. The audience in this case is the actors themselves, and they have to engage
multiple senses during it. They must engage their eyes to follow along, their ears to listen to the other actors, and their hands to turn pages. The purpose of these readings is
to invite participation from the actors and encourage them to bounce off of each other in order to get into character for their performances. The more practice the actors have with
their lines and scenes, the more complete the show is, with a fully realized vision that later encourages the audience watching to participate.</p>
