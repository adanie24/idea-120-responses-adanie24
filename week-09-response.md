<p>When it comes to consuming media on the internet, the one tool I've been subject to the most has undoubtably been targeted advertising. I don't use a lot of social media- I use less than five- but even so, it was only recently
that I discovered how many of the sites I use sell my data to third party advertisers. Thanks to an extension recommended to me by a friend, I learned that not one, not two, but *three* of the medias I use most do this. I concluded that it must be why,
whenever I would mention certain television shows I was interested in, certain video games I was looking into, or even food that I was craving at the moment, that I would soon see an ad related to it pop up while I scroll through my browser. It was unnerving,
but as Cathy O'Neil mentions in the reading, I was too intimidated by math and numbers to really do much about it. I figured, I ought to just ignore it and tell it I'm not interested as many times as I could. Or even in regards to statistics, it was
difficult for me to really trust a majority of them, and only somewhat believing in statistics that come from bigger organizations, such as the government or even RAIN, for example. And even then, a statistic doesn't really mean much if we can't
tangibly apply it to our everyday lives, or see what it looks like in the here and now. Some numbers may not even be accurate, because of how the world as a whole is constantly changing and evolving. That's why there's a new U.S. census every year, after all.</p>
<p>While I don't think getting rid of personalization on the internet as a whole is the best solution to this, I do think it needs to be regulated and restricted to prevent advertisers from being able to access private, sensitive information. Everyone
wants to make a distinct name for themselves online, and not become lost in the sea of endless content, but anything that they do make should be because it was what *they* wanted to do. Whether it be for the sake of entertainment, for creative expression,
to even making something as a gift or tribute to someone they love. Making money is not inherently a bad thing- we all need it to survive- but it should not be at the cost of human integrity.</p>
