### A Total Work of Art
<p>A *Gesamkunstwerk,* or translated from German as "total work of art", is often depicted as a piece of art that utilizes multiple different mediums in order to present specific ideas. For example, during the Italian Futurist scenographic revolution, the concept of a synthetic mise-en-scene was developed in order to combine the mediums of film and theater. The performance and actors would still be present and prominent, but instead of painters and designers being responsible for the set and atmosphere of the stage, it would all be up to the screens to depict backgrounds and scenery to match the mood. Those responsible would instead be engineers and maintenance members in order to ensure that all the machinery was working properly, to display the vision that the director intended.While the vision was never able to be fully realized back during the late 1920s, there are other ways that this can be accomplished.</p>
<p>If the goal is to create a *Gesamkuntswerk* in the form of a musical theatre production, then such tools could not only be screens that would display the backgrounds meant for each scene, but there could also be automatic rollers attached to the floor of the stage to move props and sets across the stage. It might be used with a similar system as those of metal detectors on the ground and signalling that tells a specific set piece where to move to when a certain scene comes on, similar to amusement park rides that rely on the use of centripetal force. Not only that, but the artists could digitally paint or design the artworks for the backgrounds themselves using drawing programs such as Procreate or Clip Studio Paint. There could even be captions on said screen that display the dialogue of the different characters during the performance, so the actors could focus on the emotion of the scene rather than having to project their voice. This would be in addition to making sure the actors still sing and dance without fear of bumping into any programmed props, due to the props being set on a specific timer.</p>
