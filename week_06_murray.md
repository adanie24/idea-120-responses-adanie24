<p>Janet Murray's predictions about internet television and virtual environments were successful to an extent, but not quite equivalent to what we see in the modern day.   
She is right, in the sense that the internet and television have merged in terms of personal computers marketed to students, where they can watch their favorite shows and send   \
emails and also have types of programming similar to what you would watch on television. We already see the separation of scenes as highlight videos on platforms like Youtube, as well  
as viewing a story in its entirety all at once, instead of episode by episode, through streaming platforms such as Peacock, Hulu, or Netflix.
Even the phenomenon of virtual environments from the computer becoming extensions of the fictional world were remarkably accurate, especially when considering "The Mandalorian"   
and its use of LED screens.</p>
<p>"The Mandalorian"'s hyper-realistic virtual environments do provide further immersion for both the actors and the audience at home watching. For example, instead of an   
actor having to guess where a specific mountain is with the use of green screens, they can simply gesture over to the mountain that's displayed on the LED screen. This makes the   
setting feel more real, and thus makes it easier for the audience to believe that characters would really live here, especially ones that are written to be more familiar with   
their environment. However, this isn't always used for dramatic effect or action, as Murray predicts. They can be used for rather short scenes as well, to again achieve the effect   
of making it easier for the actors to imagine themself as a character in the space, and for the audience to suspend their disbelief.</p>
