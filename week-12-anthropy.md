<p>Accessibility in video games and coding as a whole would definitely improve this art form and others in many different ways. It would allow for more diverse experiences to be represented and resonate with other marginalized people who have been through
similar things to feel seen and heard, ensuring human connection through art. That art is a reflection of their life, and the life they've lived- in all it's imperfections and joyous moments, are immortalized in this piece. Especially since a lot of things
on the internet, including video games, tend to leave a long-lasting impact, even if they aren't permanent. It would also mean that artists such as game designers, storytellers, programmers, or even voice actors who may often be overlooked because of
  their identity could either get a good start to their career, or find a role/position they're particularly passionate about and devote themselves to making sure it succeeds in getting their vision out there. Variety is always a blessing, because
it means you have endless potential for where you could go or what you could do with your life. In a way, it's much like the branching, differing routes and choices you get in games that lead to different endings- it's a way of telling a story you've always
wanted to see in a way that would enrich both you and others like you.</p>
<p>This doesn't just apply to video games, however. More voices in art forms such as theater, and even musical theater, would mean you get to see different people's interpretations of the same story. You get to see a narrative brought to life, yet it's not quite
the same story as it was the first time you saw it. Now, it has something extra, a new detail that enhances the experience, that makes the themes and the emotional weight of what's happening even more poignant. Or, in less high stakes stories, it's an extra line or
the intonation of an actor's voice that changes the meaning of a line, or makes the comedic elements more effective and hilarious. In theater, the more choice and artistic liberty you give to your cast and crew, the more of their heart you get to see.
Add more voices from more marginalized and under-represented groups, and your options become endless. It means you have a bigger sample of the human experience and what it means to be us, what brings us together while accounting for 
  and showing respect to individual differences.</p>
