<p>A type of image that would be read differently if it were in a different medium would be music album covers.</p>
<p>Music album covers are a type of image that requires the context of the songs on the album, in order to get an accurate idea of what message all the songs grouped together   
are trying to send. This also applies to covers for single songs released by artists, because it's also connected to the released tune itself. Without the audio, the   
context for the song is lost.</p>
<p>In a different medium, such as painting, these album covers might often be seen as more abtract art pieces, or self-portraits of sorts. Regardless of whether they're an   
independent artist or a popular artist under a record label, these covers would be analyzed in a way that is removed from the audio itself. Each brush stroke that comes together to   
form the image itself is brought into question, what it could be implying, why the artist chose to either represent themself or the subject themself this way. For example,   
for Orla Gartland's album cover for her single "Between my Teeth", people could take away that the red roses covering the person's face are meant to symbolize how the   
standard for romantic love is distorting our view of them, while the only parts of their body that we see are the abdomen and limbs. Even without the song's lyrics and instrumental,    
the medium itself makes us analyze the image for underlying messages.</p>
