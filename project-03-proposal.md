<p>The concept for my non-linear narrative for Twine is something I'm tentatively calling "Ollie's House." You will be playing as a protagonist named Oliver "Ollie" Macias, a college student on Winter Break, who has the apartment to himself after his roommate has
  left to spend the holidays with their family. He wakes up one night to hear strange noises coming from around his bedroom. He wakes up to find his orange tabby, Buddy, who's holding some sort of paper in his mouth. From here, you have two choices that will
determine the type of ending you get. You can either chase after Buddy and figure out what he's holding in his mouth and where he got it from, or you can leave him be for the night and explore the apartment at your own discretion. For now, following Buddy is
  the primary objective, but you can choose the second option to gain more information about Ollie's living situation.</p>
<p>For the Buddy Journey objective, you follow Buddy to the roommate's room, whose name is Juno. You find that he was holding a page of an old diary that Ollie used to consistently write in when he was 11, spanning all the way up to a few months prior to the present,
where Ollie stopped writing in it because he thought he'd misplaced it. You follow Buddy to collect the scattered pages of this diary, reading all 8 entries and looking back on everything that's happened in the last ten years. From his days in middle school,
to huge life events, to him bearing his heart out in the pages. He finds a note at the end of the last entry, indicating that Juno had kept his diary safe here, in case he ever wanted to look back on it. They'd been waiting to show it to him after they got back,
that they had it all along, and are very supportive in Ollie's growth. He smiles warmly, reattaching the pages and hugging Buddy close.</p>
<p>For the Sentimental Homebody route, Ollie gets up and goes to the fridge, looking at the food inside and deciding to microwave some empanadas for himself. He reminisces on this, remembering when Juno convinced him to finally cook for the first time in
a while. They've always been curious to try his cooking, but Ollie has pyrophobia thanks to an incident from his past that has made him avoidant of it up until this point. You learn that Ollie is the only surviving member of his family,
and that Juno has been his friend since middle school, who acts as an older sibling figure. The apartment is technically under Juno's name, but Ollie stays with them and takes care of the house while they're away at work. You also get an offhand comment suggesting
that Juno has a partner, but that's more of a fun little extra. Eventually, Ollie's brought back to the present when Buddy nudges against his leg, and you begin the Buddy Journey.</p>
